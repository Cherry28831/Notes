// Inheritance: The capability of a class to derive properties
// and characteristics from another class.
// Real Life Example: Inheriting features from parents to child.
// We don't inherit every feature, we have different features too.

// Example:-
// Human class: String name. Int age, weight.
// Student class: String name. Int age, weight, fees, roll no.
// Teacher class: String name. Int age, weight, salary, id.
// There's duplicate code in Student and Teacher class which is already
// present in Human class. To avoid this duplication, we can use Inheritance.
